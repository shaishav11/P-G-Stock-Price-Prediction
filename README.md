# P-G-Stock-Price-Prediction

Stock market prediction is the act of trying to determine the future value of a company stock or other financial instrument traded on an exchange. The successful prediction of a stock's future price could yield significant profit. 

Note: Only 2019 year data was considered with indexes from various data sources. Also, weighted average was used for predicting values for each day.

The Aim of this project was to predict open price of a stock (P&G Stock in my case) based on various indexes from previous day. Idea of the project is to focus on intraday trading. Following steps were performed:
  1. Introduction on the past and present of P&G Stock and deep understanding about the market.
  2. Statistical features of the asset price dynamics of P&G Stock.
  3. Exploratary Data Analysis and Visualization Dashboards in Tableau.
  4. Competitor Index Development using Principal Component Analysis
  5. Machine Learning Models and Strategies:
    a. Linear Regression
    b. Linear Regression with PCA
    c. Random Forest Algorithm
    d. Time Series Forecasting ARIMA model
    e. Pairs Trading Algorithm
    f. Garth Model
    g. Long Short Term Memory (RNN)
  6. Backtesting and Risk Analysis
    a. Sharpe Ratio
    b. Treynor Ratio
    c. Average Profit
    d. Hit Rate
  7. Empirical findings, profits and losses, risk analysis

Conclusion: Linear Regression with PCA proved to be the best model and evaluation of pairs trading algorithm helped us make approx. 111 USD profit on the test data set
